This directory contains solutions to the programming questions of the SSH project done at the ALX SOftware Engineering School. While doing this project, I learnt:
-What a server is
-Where servers usually live
-What SSH really is
-How to create an SSH RSA key pair
-How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
-The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash

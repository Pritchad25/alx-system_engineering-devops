## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement SSH.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What is a server
- Where servers usually live
- What is SSH
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
- All your files must be executable

## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter.
### Background Context
- Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.
- A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.
- Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.

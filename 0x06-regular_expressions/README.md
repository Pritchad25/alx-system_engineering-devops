This directory contains the programming solutions for the tasks of the DevOps Regular Expressions project. The project was done at the ALX Holberton Software Engineering School. While doing this project, I learnt the basics as well as the advanced concepts of Regular Expressions, doing exercises and also how to use a regular expression against a problem. I also learnt about Rubular.

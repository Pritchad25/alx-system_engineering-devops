- What is a reserved variable
- How to create, update and delete shell variables
- What are the roles of the following reserved variables: HOME, PATH, PS1
- What are special parameters
- What is the special parameter `$?`?

### Expansions
- What is expansion and how to use them
- What is the difference between single and double quotes and how to use them properly
- How to do command substitution with `$()` and backticks

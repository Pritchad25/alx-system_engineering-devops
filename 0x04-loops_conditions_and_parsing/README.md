## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement Control Structures and Parsing using Bash scripting.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- How to create SSH keys
- What is the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`
- How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops
- How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and `case` condition statements
- How to use the `cut` command
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
- Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version `0.7.0`) without any error
- All your files must be executable
- You are not allowed to use `awk`

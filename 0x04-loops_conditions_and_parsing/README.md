This directory contains answers to the programming tasks done at the ALX Holberton Software Engineering School.
The tasks were under the project called System Engineering & DevOps, where we particularly focused on Loops, conditions and parsing.
While doing this project, I learnt:
How to create SSH keys
The advantages of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
How to use the while, until and for loops
How to use the ifelse, elif and case condition statements
How to use the cut command
What files are and other comparison operators and how to use them.

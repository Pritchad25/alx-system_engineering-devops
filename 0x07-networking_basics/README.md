This directory contains programming solutions of the tasks of the Networking Basics project. This project was done at the ALX Software Engineering School.While doing this project, I learnt about:
-What the OSI model is, how it is organised and how many layers it has.
-the typical usage and geographical sizes of the different types of Network Topologies, eg LAN, WAN
-What the internet is, what the localhost and subnet are, what the different types of IP addresses are and why IPv6 was created.
-What the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP are
-What are the main differences between TCP and UDP
-What a port is, the SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
-What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

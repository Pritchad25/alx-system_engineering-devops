## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement Permissions in Shell or bash scripting.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
### Permissions
- What do the commands `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, `chgrp` do
- Linux file permissions
- How to represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit
- How to change permissions, owner and group of a file
- Why canâ€™t a normal user `chown` a file
- How to run a command with root privileges
- How to change user ID or become superuser

### Other Man Pages
- How to create a user
- How to create a group
- How to print real and effective user and group IDs
- How to print the groups a user is in
- How to print the effective userid

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- All your files must be executable

## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement an Application Server.
### Background Context
Your web infrastructure is already serving web pages via `Nginx` that you installed in your first webstack project. While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project you will add this piece to your infrastructure, plug it to your `Nginx` and make is serve your Airbnb clone project.

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- implement an Application Server.

## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement I/O Redirections using Pipes and implement various filter mechanisms.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a> 
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
### Shell, I/O Redirection
- What do the commands `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `tr` do
- How to redirect standard output to a file
- How to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard
- How to send the output from one program to the input of another program
- How to combine commands and filters with redirections

### Special Characters
- What are special characters
- Understand what do the white spaces, single quotes, double quotes, backslash, comment, pipe, command separator, tilde and how and when to use them

### Other Man Pages
- How to display a line of text
- How to concatenate files and print on the standard output
- How to reverse a string
- How to remove sections from each line of files
- What is the `/etc/passwd` file and what is its format
- What is the `/etc/shadow` file and what is its format

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement recursive API call, and how to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for.
### Background Context
Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for
- How to use an API with pagination
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- You must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)

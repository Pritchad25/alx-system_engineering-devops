This directory contains  the programming solutions to the tasks of the Networking Basics project. The project was done at the ALX Software Engineering School. While doing this project I learnt:
-What localhost/127.0.0.1 is 
-What 0.0.0.0 is
-What /etc/hosts is
-How to display my active network interfaces

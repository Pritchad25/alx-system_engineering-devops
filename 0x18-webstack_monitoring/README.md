## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement Webstack Monitoring.
### Background Context
“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:
- Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
- Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why is monitoring needed
- What are the 2 main area of monitoring
- What are access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
- What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
- Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version `0.7.0`) without any error
- All your files must be executable

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Pritchad25/alx-system_engineering-devops.git`
2. Access the project directory: `cd 0x18-webstack_monitoring`
3. Run any executable files within the directory
